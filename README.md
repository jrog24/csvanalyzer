Small C program designed for Unix systems. At this very moment it gives you this info about CSV file that you've pointed:
- headers,
- number of rows,
- number of columns,
- file size.

Back when I was actually working on some CSV files on Linux I was operating on tail, head etc. to get some of this info. Might be useful for example for debugging some analytic files.
